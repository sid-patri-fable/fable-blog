## Navattic

Navattic is among the pioneers in the interactive demo space, particularly popular among mid-sized companies for its product tour capabilities. Although it shines in facilitating collaboration and teamwork, the absence of a free trial, slow setup times, and a starting price of $500 per month might be drawbacks for some users.

### Navattic Pros

- **SEO-optimized demos for marketing teams:** Navattic’s focus on marketing teams means their demos are optimized for SEO, making it easier for go-to-market (GTM) teams to leverage.

- **No engineering support needed:** Users can create Navattic demos without requiring input from engineering resources, making it accessible for non-technical teams.

- **Scalability:** Navattic supports scaling demo creation processes, enabling companies to engage multiple prospects at once, which is particularly advantageous for fast-growing startups.

### Navattic Cons

- **Higher pricing:** With a pricing model on the higher end, Navattic may not be affordable for smaller businesses.

- **No demo hub/demo center:** As interactive demos become more popular with marketing teams, having a demo center to showcase multiple demos is increasingly important. Navattic does not currently offer this feature.

- **No free plan or free trial:** Prospects must book a demo with Navattic's sales team to learn more, as there is no option to start with a free plan or trial.

### Exploring alternatives to Navattic

The absence of a free trial, combined with slow implementation and higher costs, might lead teams to consider [alternative platforms](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/navattic-alternatives-and-competitors-in-2024?ref=navattic-vs-tourial-vs-fable-best-demo-platform). With pricing starting at $500 per month on an annual billing plan, deciding to go with Navattic can be challenging, especially without the opportunity to try the product beforehand.

### Tourial Cons
