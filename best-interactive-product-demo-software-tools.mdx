In the current era of product-led growth, prospective customers prefer to interact with the product and explore its various features rather than relying on demo videos or sales team interactions.

Interactive product demos are essential for sales and marketing teams. They engage prospects, showcase product value, and increase sales win rates. They help customers understand and engage with a product, making informed purchasing decisions. By allowing real-time interaction, interactive demos provide a hands-on experience that effectively communicates the product's value and benefits.

Interactive demos improve the customer buying experience by allowing them to explore the product at their own pace and stay updated on its latest features and improvements. This leads to higher user engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features to Look for in Interactive Product Demo Software Tools

When it comes to choosing the right interactive product demo software for your business, it is important to consider key features that will enhance the user experience and effectively showcase your products or services. From customization options to analytics and integration capabilities, these features can make all the difference in creating engaging and impactful product demos. By carefully evaluating these key features, you can ensure that you select a tool that will effectively showcase your offerings and leave a lasting impression on your audience. Here are a few of them to consider:

### Personalization and Customization

Consider investing in software that offers the ability for your sales reps to create personalized demos for potential customers and potential buyers, incorporating their names and company logos. This can enhance the user's experience by providing them with a more interactive and tailored demonstration of your product.

In addition to this, choose software that allows you to build custom demos based on your target audience and target industries (their user profiles, use cases, persona, and others).

### Demo Library

To make life easy for your sales, product marketing, and marketing teams, interactive demo software also has the option to create demo templates or a demo library. You can create a library of demos from which your team members can select to use for their particular requirements. This increases their productivity and ensures a standard demo usage across the board.

### Easy Demo Creation Process

Sales teams today are already stuffed with many tools in their kitty. Therefore, it is critical to choose a demo software that is extremely easy to use with user-friendly interfaces and does not require reps to individually capture screens and spend a ton of time putting together a great product demonstration.

### Collaboration Features

Most deals that your sales teams are involved in today require multi-threading. In such cases, multiple members from your potential customer's organization would want to interact with you and learn more about your product. This is why having collaboration features baked into your interactive demo platform is extremely useful for you.

### Custom Lead Forms

If you choose to gate your demos and intend to capture leads, lead forms are a no-brainer. That said, there are different ways you can design your lead form based on the inputs from your marketing team. Further, these lead forms will need to be integrated with other tools in your tech stack.

### Unlimited Demos and Demo Views

As a growing organization, the number of demos you and your team will be a part of will keep increasing. When this happens, the number of viewers for the interactive demos created will also increase. So keep in mind that you need to choose a platform that does not restrict on either of these factors.

### No-Code Editor

Though the majority of the products listed in this article have a no-code editor, there are some products that require you to involve your engineering team before you go live. If the intent in choosing an interactive demo platform is to make the life of your sales and marketing teams easier, always go with a tool that has a no-code editor.

### Affordable Pricing

Always choose a product that allows you to try before you buy. Consider future upgrades and decide based on the budget that you have in mind. With many options available in the market, it is very much possible to consider an interactive demo platform that is easy on the pocket.

### Flexible Sharing Options

A kickass interactive demo has a multitude of use cases. From marketing to sales and customer success, many teams can use them to improve their KPIs. To ensure this happens, choose a product demo software that makes it easy for you to share in different formats.

### Advanced Analytics

No software is complete without a proper analytics module. For demo software in particular, this helps you with critical insights on your team's performance as well the engagement of your prospects. This not only helps you increase your win rates but also in sharing internal feedback for product improvement and enhancements.

### Priority Support

Considering the importance of demos in any given sales process, always opt for demo software that provides priority support on the go. You never know when you need help. There's nothing worse than putting up an embarrassing face on a demo call, so better choose a tool that takes care of you well enough.

### Integrations

With so many other tools in your tech stack already, it is important for interactive sales demo software to integrate seamlessly with all/ most of them. There are very few tools today that do this today, so choose wisely.

## In Conclusion

 A kickass interactive demo can boost your sales and marketing efforts. While multiple options are out there in the market, each software has unique features, making it crucial to compare them before you choose to buy one of them.
