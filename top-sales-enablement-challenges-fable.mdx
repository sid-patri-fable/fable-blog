The advantages of an effective sales enablement program are undeniable. A robust sales enablement strategy can offer enhanced sales productivity, more wins, and improved sales training programs.

Nevertheless, despite the potential benefits, sales professionals such as sales managers and leaders may need help with sales enablement.

This is the nature of doing business in dynamic markets. Sales enablement professionals should be prepared for risks to sales productivity, alignment with marketing teams, sales onboarding efficiency, and other key operational areas.

The best way to stay ahead of these challenges is to understand what they are and how they might manifest in the day-to-day operations of a sales organization.

Another ideal way to navigate these challenges is by implementing the best sales enablement software to drive collaboration, automate workflows, and deliver data insights. Your sales enablement software will be at the core of your sales enablement strategy, so leverage it to solve obstacles and mitigate risks as they appear.

## Why is sales enablement very complex?

This complexity stems from two primary factors: sales enablement's status as a relatively new discipline and the demanding nature of enabling sales, which is further intensified by the need for intricate interdepartmental collaboration between sales teams and marketing departments.

## Sales enablement challenges

Here are some common challenges faced by sales enablement teams: 

### No alignment between your sales and marketing teams

Ultimately, sales reps rely on marketing teams to generate leads, while marketing expects sales to close them — it's a mutually beneficial relationship. However, issues can arise if the two teams aren't communicating thoroughly, effectively, and consistently.

This miscommunication between marketing and sales teams can occur when:

- Marketing teams fail to share new audience pain points they observe through research and social listening with sales, or vice versa.

- Sales teams are unaware of new marketing content or sales collateral that could aid in their selling efforts.

- Neither team is well-versed in the company's products and philosophies.

- Both teams have differing perceptions of the audience's challenges, demographics, and ideal solutions.

To align marketing and sales teams, working together to define or refine your company's target audience is crucial. For instance, if marketing is creating content for "ABCs" and sales aims to engage "XYZs," your company's growth will likely be stunted. Conducting buyer persona interviews with past customers can provide valuable insights into your target audience.
 
### Your sales content does not resonate with your audience

Content is essential for satisfying audience needs, especially in sales. Having a variety of content for different stages of the sales process is important for meeting customer expectations. Gaps in content assets can hinder the sales process.

Businesses require a variety of content types, including blogs, social media posts, white papers, eBooks, case studies, client presentations, product spec guides, buyer personas, and more.

The list could go on. Not only do you need different forms of sales enablement content, but also materials for various purposes, like customer education versus brand awareness. Having more content can increase the effectiveness of sales reps in addressing customer pain points and influencing purchasing decisions.

Sales enablement technology plays a crucial role in enhancing content in three key ways:

- A unified platform for content helps sales reps efficiently access marketing materials without wasting time on fruitless searches.

- A sales enablement solution helps identify any gaps in your content library to prevent oversight.

- Enablement software fosters better collaboration between marketing teams and sales teams.

Sales enablement tools can help sales managers and stakeholders address top-line concerns by creating a single digital environment for accessing, updating, and sharing content. This can save time that can be used for value-added efforts such as personalization or creating future content.

 
### You may not be fully utilizing your CRM

A customer relationship management (CRM) platform is an essential asset that shouldn't be overlooked, as it helps your company manage leads and all associated data. With a CRM, you can easily track a lead's website activity, calls, emails, meeting notes, and more. You can also monitor closed deals and their size in an easy-to-see view.

An effective CRM can enhance the transparency of your sales team and improve reporting. It is essential to ensure everyone is in agreement with its implementation. That is where certain companies face challenges. A mandate from top management may be necessary to ensure proper usage by all.

Using a CRM system is excellent for automating routine tasks like sending emails. Additionally, you can set up marketing automation to nurture leads at just the right time — without lifting a finger.

 
### Data analysis is not included in your process

If your sales teams and marketing teams are communicating about sales enablement content and its creation, they should also be tracking how leads progress through the sales funnel. Are leads consistently getting stuck at the same stage? Is the sales team dealing with too many unqualified leads? Are leads pain points never fully addressed?

Reporting on lead progression through your sales cycle will highlight areas needing improvement. Once your team identifies these issues, they can address them effectively.

While analyzing and reporting data may not be a forte for some employees, providing coaching and ongoing training can unlock your business's potential. It will pay off in the long run if your teams are eager to learn. Data analysis pairs well with data visualization, so dive into tools like Google Analytics, Excel, or other preferred data visualization tools to communicate your progress and success.
