The product demo is an essential part of the sales process, and the demo script plays a crucial role in bringing the live demo to life. The effectiveness of the demo script can impact the outcome of the deal.

Creating a comprehensive set of guidelines for a demo script will ensure successful demos every time.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for planning, creating, and preparing a successful demo script for your sales teams.

## Right then, what's a demo script?

Let's just say that it is a simple guide that sales teams use during their demos to help them build their narrative. It clearly highlights what to do and what not to do during your demo presentations.

In general, demo scripts include the order in which different topics need to be addressed: from understanding customer pain points, knowing why they are having a specific pain point, product's unique selling proposition, among many others. Detailed instructions on handling objections during demo calls are also included. The goal of a demo script is to not just have a consistent way of working through every single deal but to make sure that your prospects' interest in your product continues to grow.

Having a well-structured demo script will help sales teams deliver deal-winning demos every single time.

## Are demo scripts crucial for sales success?

Buyers today have a lot of information before they start talking to sales teams. They are also very well aware of all their options. Under such circumstances, it becomes extremely critical for all sales teams to be on top of their game during demo presentations. A good demo script helps sales teams achieve this every day.

Let's see some more benefits that demo scripts have to offer:

- A well-prepared sales team: Demo scripts act as the secret sauce for sales teams. The checklists help them be absolutely ready before every call. The positive effects of this can't be stressed enough.
- Faster training and onboarding: This also helps newer reps ramp up faster. Demo scripts allow sales reps to be confident even during their initial set of calls.
- Preparedness to handle objections: Handing objections is something that every sales rep is trained on. A well-structured demo script guides you in addressing all common objections that might come up during demo presentations.
- Demo standardization: Following a prepared script during the demo will ensure consistency in the narrative and prevent confusion for the prospect.

## Things to keep in mind before creating a demo scripts

- Have clearly laid out buyer personas: Understanding your typical buyer's pain points and their needs will help you in tailoring the demo script. Knowing as much as possible about your target audience is critical. Think of this as an exercise to create your ideal customer profile (ICP).
- Make it interactive: Having an engaging audience during your presentation is half the job done. This means that you should just not go overboard by talking about every single feature your product has to offer.
- Reiterate often: It is extremely important to reiterate on demo scripts based on performance, feedback, and learnings. This way, it helps everyone on the team stay ahead of the competition.
- Include case studies instead of bombarding with customer logos: Potential customers are more concerned about how your product can solve their pain points than just looking at fancy logos on your website. Helping them with customer testimonials and case studies of how your product has helped other companies tackle similar problems goes a long way in building trust and credibility.
- Include guidelines on handling objections: Think of flashcards here. Sales reps should be able to use these to answer all common objections that customers might come up with during their presentations.

## How to create a winning demo script?

A winning demo script must help sales reps remain confident throughout the demo presentation. Further, it will make your sales reps be considered subject matter experts on every call. That said, here are a few key elements to include in demo scripts going forward.

- Have a solid introduction: This should let your prospects know that you are well prepared and have a clear agenda that will help both parties involved in the meeting.
- Highlight how your product solves your potential customer's pain points: This will let the prospects know whether or not they should be investing more time in evaluating your product.
- Showcase case studies of customers with similar problems: This will help you build trust and credibility.
- Keep it engaging: Include questions to keep the prospects interested. Talk less and listen more.
- Make the demo personalized: Having a generalized demo for everyone doesn't work anymore. Make sure that your demo scripts are personalized based on the use case, buyer persona, among others.
- Unleash your product's USP: Show your prospects why your product is the real deal. Your key features are all you need to highlight (your 10x features). Get them hooked and highlight your product's unique features and workflows.
- Clearly lay out the next steps and a detailed mutual action plan: This will help your prospects stick to the agreed-upon timelines and will help you manage your deals effectively.
- Have a simple outline for a summary: Summarizing a demo call effectively is extremely important. As always, do not forget to include the summary in your follow-up emails.
