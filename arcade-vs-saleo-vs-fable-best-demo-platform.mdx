Arcade is a basic demo platform that provides a simpler alternative to Loom for creating video demos. It’s particularly suited for smaller teams or organizations, allowing quick creation of video demos using screenshots. Arcade excels in delivering concise onboarding and training materials.

### Arcade Pros

- **Multimedia content:** You can add audio, background music, and visuals, which enhances user engagement.

- **Export options:** Demos can be exported in formats like GIF or MP4 for ease of sharing.

- **Time efficiency:** The platform allows for quick creation of demos and training materials, saving time when compared to traditional video production methods.

### Arcade Cons

- **Limited flexibility:** Since it only supports video-based demos, Arcade may not meet the needs of teams requiring more dynamic content.

- **Lack of advanced features:** While easy to use, some users find Arcade lacking in advanced customization options and editing tools.

- **No interactivity:** Arcade’s video-based demos don’t allow for interaction with HTML elements, limiting the depth of engagement.

### Exploring alternatives to Arcade

Due to the lack of HTML capabilities and limited customization features, teams may explore [alternative platforms](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/arcade-alternatives-and-competitors-in-2024?ref=arcade-vs-saleo-vs-fable-best-demo-platform) that offer more interactive and flexible demo creation, especially as their product or go-to-market strategy evolves.

## Saleo

Saleo is a sales-focused demo platform that allows teams to personalize their demos by adding custom data layers over the actual product interface. This approach makes sales presentations more relevant and tailored to specific prospects, improving engagement and reducing the preparation time needed for demos.

### Saleo Pros

- **Customization:** Saleo lets teams overlay custom data onto their product to create tailored, prospect-specific demos.

- **Data relevance:** By customizing data for each prospect, Saleo helps make product demos more engaging and easier for potential buyers to understand.

- **Simplified maintenance:** Once your environment is set up, Saleo is easier to maintain compared to some other demo tools, ensuring that your demos remain relevant over time.

### Saleo Cons

- **Limited to sales teams:** Saleo primarily focuses on the needs of sales teams, offering fewer features for marketing or customer success.

- **Data modification:** Changes to demo data require assistance from Saleo’s support team, which could slow down the demo creation process.

- **Complex initial setup:** Setting up Saleo can be difficult, especially for complex demo environments, requiring additional coordination with their team.

### Exploring alternatives to Saleo

With a high setup time and reliance on ongoing modifications, many teams might find it beneficial to explore [alternative platforms](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/saleo-alternatives-and-competitors-in-2024?ref=arcade-vs-saleo-vs-fable-best-demo-platform). Additionally, with a starting price of $40,000 per year, Saleo may not be an ideal choice for smaller or scaling teams.

## Fable

Fable is designed for both marketing and sales teams, providing a highly customizable demo platform that improves engagement and simplifies the sales process. The platform is equipped with advanced analytics and integrates seamlessly with other tools, making it a robust solution for businesses aiming to boost their sales success.

### Fable Pros

- **Deep customizations:** Fable’s HTML customization capabilities allow teams to edit, hide, blur, or delete elements in demos, making it a versatile choice for different teams.

- **No engineering support needed:** Built for non-technical users, Fable enables marketing and sales teams to create and manage demos independently, without relying on engineering resources.

- **Advanced analytics:** Fable offers detailed insights into how prospects interact with demos, enabling teams to optimize presentations and increase engagement.

### Fable Cons

- **Limited user seats:** The platform doesn’t offer unlimited user seats, which might restrict access for larger teams.

- **Product replication:** Fable creates a replica of your product for demo purposes, limiting the ability to directly modify the live version during a demo.

## Feature comparison

### Free trial

- **Fable:** Offers a 14-day free trial across all plans, along with a free plan for creating a single demo.

- **Arcade:** Provides a free trial so users can explore the platform before committing.

### AI demos

- **Fable:** The latest version includes AI tools that help create detailed, end-to-end demos.

- **Arcade:** No AI capabilities are currently available.

- **Saleo:** Saleo doesn’t support AI-driven demos at this time.

### Responsive design

- **Fable:** Ensures demos are mobile-optimized, delivering a seamless experience across all devices.

- **Arcade:** Uses screenshots, which can be scaled down for mobile use but lack dynamic responsiveness.

- **Saleo:** Since Saleo relies on your product’s live environment, the responsiveness is dependent on the product itself.

### Type of demos

- **Fable:** Supports advanced demo hubs, allowing users to create collections of demos tailored to different needs and personas.

- **Arcade:** Allows demo collections through its hub feature, though limited to video formats.

- **Saleo:** Works with live product data, directly reflecting the product environment.
