## Software demo presentations - what exactly are they?

A live software demo is a tool that sales teams utilize to demonstrate a SaaS product to prospective buyers. It is a visual walkthrough of the software. Sales reps, solution engineers, and account executives rely heavily on visual demonstrations to showcase the product's functionality to buyers, and to engage, attract, and persuade them.

Software customers require a method to evaluate the product, comprehend its functionality, and assess its features and advantages prior to making a purchasing decision. The software sales demo provides an opportunity for the sales teams to allow buyers to experience your product. An interactive demo created with [Fable](https://www.sharefable.com/) can be used during the sales demo phase of the buyer journey, providing prospects with links that they can engage with on their own at any point during the sales experience.

Learning to [create an interactive product demo](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/how-to-create-interactive-product-demos) can be straightforward, especially on a [platform like Fable](https://www.sharefable.com/products). Today, we will discuss how to make the demo presentation impressive and delve into the more challenging aspects.

## 7 Essential elements for a good software demo presentation

Having learned about what a software demo is, it is important to explore the essential components of a great software demo presentation:

### An opening to remember

Begin your demo with something that captures the viewer's attention. Possible options for a welcome message include a variety of methods such as an interesting statistic that relates to their specific pain point, successful customer stories who faced a similar problem, an appealing image, or even a video.

Remember, first impressions make a huge difference!

### Personalized to the target audience and their problem

Before you start creating a software demo, ask yourself this - what the buyer persona is, and what their problem is?

Highlight the potential benefits of your product to meet their requirements. Including personalized elements in the product demo, such as the prospect's name and company logo, can enhance their understanding that the demo was tailored specifically for them.

### Focus on the value that ties back to their pain point

Once you have collected all the necessary information, analyze how your product features can address your prospect's biggest challenges. To maintain viewer engagement with your demo, it is important to not solely focus on guiding them through your product. Develop a compelling story that addresses the areas of concern.

Ensure the story of the demo revolves around what the buyer wants to know about your software.

### A strong demo script with engaging content

To create a successful software demo, it is important to have a [well-crafted demo script](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/complete-guide-to-writing-winning-demo-scripts) that incorporates a compelling storyline to capture the customer's interest. A demo script that starts with a problem, provides a solution, and highlights the benefits of the product is an effective approach. Include various engaging elements such as GIFs, humor, sales memes, rich text, movie references, sports references, or any other topic the prospect finds interesting to enhance this demo.

The gist of it all is - whatever you do, please don't be boring!

### An interactive product demo that wows the buyers

Of course, nobody just wants to hear how a product will solve their problem, but want to see how the product actually works. They want to learn how to navigate and utilize all the features effectively. It is important to carefully break down the process into small steps by following a step-by-step guide. Provide your audience with the link to their customized software demo and allow them to try it on their own.

Keep them engaged by having them click through the product so that they can see how it works and the value it can bring them.

### Strong CTAs that get them to take actions

The demo presentation should be aligned with the purpose of its creation by including a strong call to action. If your goal is to increase sign-ups for a free trial, your call to action could be "Sign up for a free trial."

Include clear calls to action (CTAs) throughout your software demo to guide your audience through the next steps of the process.

### Clear metrics to measure engagement

Analyze the analytics to assess factors such as the timing of demo views, duration of views on different screens, viewership demographics, etc. This will allow your sales team to effectively follow up with the prospect.

Use this information to fine-tune your future demos and make them failproof.

## Common mistakes to avoid in a software demo presentation

Regardless of how excellent your software may be, if it is not effectively presented, it will not capture and engage decision-makers interest. Below are some common mistakes seen in sales demos that sales representatives often make.

### Feature dumping without regard to their pain point

Your prospective client is not interested in hearing about the features of your product and how amazing they are. They are solely focused on how those features can address their issue. Emphasize on the product features that can benefit them, rather than simply discussing its capabilities. Focus on the value rather than the functionality.

### Making the conversation a one-way street

Most demo presenters go on a monologue about your product while flipping through a slide deck. There is nothing worse for a potential client than having to stay awake through a conversation that has so little role for them.

Utilize interactive sales demos to effectively engage your audience. Address them by their name. During a Zoom demo, it's recommended to pause screen sharing for important moments so that your audience can see your face. Please ask any questions you may have in the chat to better understand their interest in specific features.

### Sticking to the script with no regard for the buyer's POV

It is recommended to create a demo script, prepare, and practice before giving a demo presentation. However, it can be uncomfortable if the prospect asks a question that is not in your script and you are unable to answer.

One way to solve the problem is by becoming more adaptable in utilizing the script. If the prospect asks questions, it is important to take a moment to pause and respond to their inquiries.

## A guide on how to create a software demo presentation

When presenting a demo, it is beneficial to plan ahead and organize your presentation in order to maintain control and effectively respond to any unexpected situations on the field. It is beneficial to be prepared, confident, and have a structured flow during your demo presentation.

### Start with a warm introduction

The main purpose of introducing yourself is to establish a connection with the prospect. After introducing yourself, provide a brief overview of your product demonstration and outline the agenda for the call. Ending the introduction with a question, such as "What are your thoughts on this agenda?" creates an opportunity for discussion.

### Highlight the product features that solve their problem

As stated previously, it is recommended not to overload your demo with excessive features and unnecessary details of your tool. Instead, consider the potential customer's concerns and connect the features as a solution to those concerns. It is your responsibility to ensure that you explain to them how your product can offer value to them as a team and individually. To achieve this, it is necessary to have a strong grasp of their goals and objectives.

### Take them to the Aha! moment of the conversation

Find a way to create a memorable 'Aha!' moment for the prospect that will make them remember you and your product. This is the time to demonstrate your showmanship to your prospect, rather than simply talking about it. Using an interactive product demo can help create an 'Aha!' moment sooner by allowing the prospect to try out the tool on their own, in a sandbox environment, without the involvement of a salesperson.

Additionally, one can enhance their demo by preparing questions to ask their prospects. Beginning the demo with a conversation will ensure that the next chunk of time is not spent in a monologue.

### Engage them in a question-and-answer segment

A higher level of engagement leads to an increased likelihood of purchasing. Encourage them to ask questions to ensure ongoing engagement with the demo. It is recommended to establish a connection by being relatable and personable whenever feasible. Establishing genuine relationships can help ensure that your prospects remember and value your advice.

### Communicate the next steps clearly and close

Please conclude the demo presentation by restating the message and providing a call to action or outlining the next step. Would you like the prospect to complete a form, arrange a follow-up online meeting, or proceed to the final stage of signing the deal? Include your next action in your demo script and ensure clear communication before concluding the presentation.
