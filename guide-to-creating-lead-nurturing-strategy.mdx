As companies incorporate inbound marketing to increase lead generation, the significance of a proficient lead nurturing strategy becomes evident. Typically, only a small portion of your inbound leads will be prepared to make an immediate purchase, while the majority of your inbound leads will remain unconverted. To increase the likelihood of converting leads into paying customers, it is important to establish meaningful relationships with them and deliver relevant content throughout their purchasing process.

Implementing an effective lead nurturing strategy can significantly influence the outcomes of your inbound marketing strategy, customer loyalty, customer retention, revenue, and other factors.

This report provides a detailed examination of lead nurturing, including an explanation of its purpose, the methods used, current effective communication channels, and instructions for creating your strategy.

Let's go!

## What Is Lead Nurturing And What Are Its Benefits?

Lead nurturing is the process of establishing valuable relationships with potential customers by delivering suitable and pertinent content throughout the buyer's journey. The main objective is to guide customers through the sales funnel and help them move toward making a purchase decision.

Lead nurturing strategies are developed because not all leads generated by marketing teams are sales-ready. Although potential customers may have an initial interest in your product or service, they often have inquiries and doubts that must be addressed before progressing from the awareness stage to the decision stage.

The following are some of the significant benefits of lead nurturing:

- **Building relationships**: Lead nurturing involves various aspects beyond simply selling a product. The focus is on establishing trust and credibility. By consistently offering valuable information, you are establishing a connection with your leads, increasing the likelihood that they will choose your business when they are ready to make a purchase.
- **Educating and informing**: Customers typically require a period of research before finalizing their decision on a product. Lead nurturing assists in educating potential customers about the advantages of your product, addressing any concerns they may have, and supporting them in making well-informed decisions.
- **Shortening sales cycle**: Effective lead nurturing can help speed up the sales process by ensuring continuous brand awareness. When leads consistently receive pertinent information, they are more inclined to progress through your sales funnel at a faster pace.
- **Increasing conversion rates**: Having a good understanding of your leads' needs and creating tailored content can increase the likelihood of converting them into customers. Personalized and targeted communication has been proven to have a positive impact on conversion rates and can also lead to an increase in average order value (AOV).
- **Reducing marketing costs**: Nurturing existing leads can be a more cost-effective strategy compared to acquiring new ones. Maintaining relationships with potential customers who have expressed interest in your products or services can lead to a noticeable decrease in customer acquisition expenses.

An important thing to remember when thinking about lead nurturing is that even qualified leads have to be nurtured to result in conversion. A lot of sellers have noted that over half the qualified leads in their pipeline aren't ready to buy. A continuous lead nurturing process where metrics like engagement, click rate, and sales conversions are measured and in turn feed into improving the process of lead nurturing is the secret sauce to unlocking the full value of the qualified leads already in the system.

## How Does One Nurture Leads?

The process of nurturing leads involves engaging your target audience with relevant information, providing support as needed, and ensuring a positive experience throughout the buying journey.

Nurturing leads is essential for business success as these tactics have a direct impact on a customer's decision to convert into paying customers. There are various strategies for nurturing leads, such as targeted content, multi-channel nurturing, multiple touches, timely follow-ups, and personalization.

Marketers may face difficulties in developing the appropriate strategy for lead nurturing, despite its evident advantages. In a recent [Lead Nurturing & Acceleration Survey](https://www.demandgenreport.com/resources/research/2019-lead-nurturing-acceleration-survey-report), 60% of respondents rated their nurture programs as not successful.

There is a big opportunity for businesses to set themselves apart and gain an advantage over their competitors by implementing effective lead nurturing strategies. In the next section, we take a look at some of the components of an effective lead nurturing strategy.

## 6 Pillars Of An Effective Lead Nurturing Strategy

The following six components should be a part of any lead nurturing strategy respective of the business:

### Utilize targeted content

In the context of lead nurturing, it is important to recognize that there is no universal solution that fits every situation. Research has shown that nurturing leads with targeted content can greatly improve results.

Begin by acquiring a thorough understanding of each unique buyer persona. Next, develop a selection of personalized content created to support and engage each of your personas depending on their interests, goals, objectives, and marketing triggers.

It is advisable to utilize a marketing automation platform to efficiently identify, segment, and target your distinct buyer personas as you expand your strategy.

### Implement multi-channel lead nurturing

In the past, lead nurturing strategies typically involved the implementation of a basic email drip campaign that would distribute generic emails to a list of potential customers.

At present, marketers are exploring innovative strategies and technologies that go beyond email nurturing. Marketers are using powerful marketing automation platforms to execute multi-channel lead nurturing strategies. Effective multi-channel lead nurturing typically involves a combination of marketing automation, email marketing, social media, paid retargeting, dynamic website content, and direct sales outreach. To execute this effectively, it is important to ensure that your sales and marketing teams are aligned and working together.

### Ensure multiple touchpoints

The buyer's journey for each product and service can vary, but research indicates that, on average, prospects receive ten marketing touches from the moment they become aware of your company until they convert into customers.

The most successful lead nurturing strategies provide content that guides prospects through the buyer's journey by addressing their questions and concerns. In addition to email tactics, it is important to consider using a combination of content types such as social media, blog posts, whitepapers, interactive calculators, or even direct mail, to effectively nurture prospects and turn them into customers.

### Timely follow-ups with leads

Automated lead nurturing can assist in reaching large groups of prospects, however, a timely follow-up email or phone call is frequently the most effective method for converting leads into qualified sales opportunities. The chances of converting a lead into a sales opportunity increase significantly when the lead is contacted immediately after a website conversion.

Making a timely and well-planned call to an inbound lead is more effective than a high volume of cold calling. Based on their recent browsing behavior, you have a clear understanding of what the prospect is researching. Additionally, you have enough information to conduct initial research on the organization they work for and their role within the company.

### Emphasis on personalized emails

Email marketing remains an effective strategy for nurturing leads, with the personalization of these emails yielding improved outcomes. There are various methods to personalize emails to enhance your lead nurturing strategy. Triggered emails can be sent when a visitor completes actions such as downloading gated content, clicking on links, visiting specific website pages, or showing high engagement signals.

By combining marketing personalization with behavioral triggered emails, it is possible to deliver targeted marketing messages to individuals when they are most receptive.

### Well-designed lead scoring

Lead scoring is a methodology used to rank prospects based on their perceived value to the organization.

Lead scoring can be implemented in most marketing automation platforms through the assignment of numeric values to specific website browsing behaviors, conversion events, or even social media interactions.

The resulting score is utilized to determine the appropriate course of action for following up with leads, whether that involves direct contact from a sales representative or further nurturing.

## Creating A Lead Nurturing Strategy For Your Business

Here are the steps to creating the best lead nurturing strategy that can propel your business to the next level:

### Ensure there is alignment between marketing and sales

The initial step in B2B lead nurturing strategies is to align marketing and sales teams. Both teams need to come to a mutual understanding of what constitutes a lead and maintain consistent communication regarding lead qualification.

If the lead meets the criteria for being sales-ready, pass them along to the sales team for handling. If the lead is not ready to make a purchase, transfer them to the marketing team for further nurturing. The lead nurturing process continues until the leads are ready for sales.

### Establish a process for lead management

When generating leads, it is important to have a well-defined lead generation process in place to effectively manage incoming leads. In addition, a well-defined lead management process enables the sales team to focus their communication efforts on the most qualified leads, while also filtering out those that are less qualified and placing them into lead nurturing campaigns.

The marketing and sales teams should collaborate to generate a comprehensive list of factors to be taken into account during the lead management process. Some of the things they should have clarity on are:

- What are the criteria for lead qualification?
- What is the process for registering leads and where does it occur?
- How and when will the follow-up on the leads happen?
- What criteria are to be used to determine which leads will be placed into the lead nurturing program?

### Gather lead intelligence data

The lead nurturing strategy involves the distribution of targeted and personalized content to leads. Collecting lead data is essential. Below are a few ways to obtain them:

- Conduct interviews or surveys with customers or potential customers.
- Interview with the customer support team.
- Interview with the sales team for their tribal knowledge.
- Data mining is used to identify customer profiles and specific characteristics.
- Analyzing the online behavior and buying processes of potential customers.
- Keyword tools can be used to identify the topics of interest and key search terms for prospects.

After obtaining the data, create buyer personas or ideal customer profiles to gain a deeper understanding of your prospects and assist them in their purchasing journey.

### Develop a content program

A recommended practice in a lead nurturing strategy is to develop a content timeline that outlines the scheduling of communication and delivery intervals. At first, your content plan for lead nurturing can be straightforward and just consist of resources that you already have that are useful for the buyer in their day-to-day business.

### Utilize email marketing as a means of communication

Emails are an effective method for contacting leads. You could broadly classify the types of emails at your disposal into one of the four buckets:

- **Educational emails**: Providing educational content such as blog articles, white papers, and videos is an effective way to inform leads about the value of your product.
- **Email newsletters**: The email newsletters can include industry insights, blog posts, event announcements, and other content.
- **Event invites**: Event invites may include hosting webinars, trade shows, and organizing conferences.
- **Personal one-to-one emails**: Personalized emails with specific content to leads who are in the later stages of the buying process.

### Continuously track, measure & analyze the lead nurturing process

Sales intelligence tools and lead nurturing tools can be used to track metrics and measure the performance of drip emails, email engagements, and other lead nurturing efforts.

When setting goals, it is important to track the relevant metrics. For awareness, track direct website traffic. For increasing leads, measure database growth, audience engagement, incoming leads, leads handled by the sales team, and leads in the nurturing program.

First, it is important to comprehend their needs before guiding them through the purchasing process. Surveys provide a better understanding of prospects. Data is collected about individual leads to ensure they are approached correctly.

Send surveys with relevant questions about the leads' pain points and requirements. Examine the responses to identify behavioral factors, engagement factors, and other helpful information. Afterward, one can proceed to take necessary actions based on these valuable customer insights. The integration of survey data with website behavioral data enables a comprehensive approach to lead nurturing.

### Retargeting with ads

If your email marketing is effective, it may be beneficial to consider implementing retargeting across various platforms. Using both newsletters and retargeting campaigns helps ensure that your business remains at the forefront of your prospects' minds.

There are two primary retargeting options - social media retargeting and display retargeting.

- **Social Media Retargeting**: Social media retargeting is the practice of displaying specific advertisements to individuals who have previously engaged with your website, app, or other online material.
