## About Walnut

Walnut is a popular demo platform for large sales teams looking to create clickable demos or demo environments. Enterprise companies choose Walnut for its robust platform and its deep customizations.

However, the lack of a free trial, slow implementation, less flexibility, steep learning curve, and higher pricing might prompt a search for an alternative product. With a pricing that starts from $10,000/year, it can become hard to take a decision if you are a growing team without having an option to try the product out in the first place.
