Navattic is a well-established player in the interactive demo space, known for its product tour software, which is popular among mid-sized companies. While it shines in promoting collaboration and supporting teams, the lack of a free trial, slower setup process, and pricing starting at $500 per month may deter potential users.

### Navattic cons
