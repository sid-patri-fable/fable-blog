Walnut is a demo platform crafted for sales teams, enabling them to build interactive, clickable demos for live presentations or as follow-ups after sales meetings. Walnut’s no-code interface empowers users to easily create and customize demos, making the sales process smoother and more engaging.

### Walnut Pros

### Exploring alternatives to Walnut

With pricing starting at $10,000 per year, it can be tough for growing teams to justify the investment without the ability to try it first.

### Reprise Cons

- **Limited mobile optimization:** Reprise is primarily built for web-based applications, offering limited support for mobile app demos, which may be an issue for businesses that prioritize mobile-first strategies.

- **Integration challenges:** Some users have experienced difficulties exporting demos or integrating Reprise with tools like HubSpot, often requiring additional customization or engineering work.

### Exploring alternatives to Reprise

Due to the complex implementation process, limited flexibility, and high costs (starting at $30,000 annually), teams might look into [alternative options](https://www.sharefable.com/blog/reprise-alternatives-and-competitors-in-2024?ref=walnut-vs-reprise-vs-fable-best-demo-platform), especially if they’re aiming for a more cost-effective, scalable solution.
